There are currently multiple paradigms for the regression tests as we transition
to the preferred version.

The preferred version is based on running the actual GRINS executable, then using
the regression testing app to compare against gold solution values as well as,
optional, gold QoI values. See the parsed_qoi.sh and hot_cylinder.sh for examples
of usage. 

There are a couple of important points for the preferred paradigm:

1. We are assuming that the primary libMesh::System name is "GRINS-TEST", so
   be sure to set the system_name variable to 'GRINS-TEST' in the test input file.

2. These tests are meant to operate by running the grins app directly, which will write
   out a restart file (and possibly QoI data). Then, the regression_testing_app
   will run and load the restart file
   to compare against the exact solution (supplied on the command line). To maintain
   the integrity of the parallel builds, each restart file *must* be named uniquely.
   Thus, the rule here is to name the restart file the same as the test, e.g.
   if the test was named navier_stokes_2d.sh, then the restart should be named
   navier_stokes_2d.xdr.

3. Gold data should be xdr files, to help keep the size of the repo down, but
   have the grins run generate an xda file so that the data can be readily
   examined by a human if need be.


An older, but substandard version, are the tests that use the generic_solution_regression
program. These will be migrated to the preferred version.

The oldest and most subpar are the standalone programs that have lots of code duplication.
Those, too, will be migrated where possible.
